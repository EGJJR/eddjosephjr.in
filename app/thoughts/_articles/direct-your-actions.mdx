This is the first official email for my personal newsletter, which is a space to share my learnings, reflections, and thoughts as I go through my own personal journey. :)

## The Daily Stoic

Recently I’ve been reading the book “The Daily Stoic”, and it has been seriously expanding my mind and reshaping how I approach life. Certainly a book I highly recommend. My reading process is simple:

>- I read {/*<sup>1</sup>*/}

>- I ponder {/*<sup>2</sup>*/}

>- I reread {/*<sup>3</sup>*/}

And here right now, at the moment of me writing this—29th of November, 2:51am EST, I wanted to share with you a thought that I’ve been sitting with for the past few weeks.

### SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 12.5

>“Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in view. It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that >drive them mad.”

## Analysis

This quote resonates with me as a framework for life. It reminds me that direction and purpose are crucial for peace and fulfillment. When our actions lack a clear purpose, we risk being consumed by chaos and frustration. This idea is echoed in other works like The 48 Laws of Power (Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End) and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Begin with the End in Mind).

Without an end in mind, how can we evaluate our progress or know when we’re off track? How can we prioritize what truly matters? As the Stoics caution, directionless effort leads not only to failure but to madness.

For me, this awareness is a compass guiding my actions and decisions. It shapes how I approach my work, relationships, and values. It’s why I’ve taken time to reflect on some of the ways that I want to be remembered:

- >As someone who genuinely cared for others.

- >Who nurtured himself, his family, and those he loved.

- >Who inspired others to be better.

- >Who designed and lived the life he truly wanted.

- >Who became a great thinker, builder, and innovator.

This vision gives me clarity.

Each day, I ask myself:
- >Are my actions aligned with the person I aspire to be?

- >Am I living with intention?

I encourage you to reflect on this too. What’s the end you’re working towards? What do you want out of life? Are your efforts directed at something meaningful, or are you letting false conceptions steer you off course?

>I hope this reflection inspires you as much as it has inspired me.

>E.J.
