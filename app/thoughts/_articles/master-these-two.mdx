I’ve been thinking about this one concept nonstop for a few weeks.

**There are two fundamental principles that will take you far:**

>Get things done.
>Be good with people.

I know, sounds simple. Almost too simple. But those two have more depth than we give them credit for.

I was talking with an Andrews University alum who works in software product. Not an engineer. Not a typical path. But someone who’s consistently moved forward. I asked him what helped him thrive and his answer stuck with me:

>“These are skills that you can’t really put on a resume, but people will notice and appreciate over time as they work with you. They sound obvious, and >they are, but you’d be surprised how many people don’t have one or the other or both.”

Here’s the nuance:

>You can succeed by being great at execution and not great with people, but rarely the reverse. Being liked won’t carry you far if you don’t deliver.

>Execution builds trust.
>People skills build buy-in.

**You need both.**

It made me ask myself, am I dependable? Do people feel lighter after working with me, or heavier? Can they trust me to follow through?

These are things no certificate, bootcamp, or degree can teach. It’s how you move. How you listen. How you show up.

If you’re reading this, I hope it makes you reflect too.

This post isn’t here to teach.
It’s here to remind.

**Master the basics.**
>Get things done. Be good with people.

That’ll take you further than you think.
