# Edd  Joseph Jr.

I am an AI Engineer Intern at [UChicago Medicine/AdventHealth](https://www.uchicagomedicineadventhealth.org/), a CS student at Andrews University (graduating 2026 with BSc), and the CTO of [Creator Cash](https://www.creatorcash.tech/). My interests span across a spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development, creative coding, design, history, business, and human-technology interaction.

Since starting college, Iâ€™ve spent years on freelance web design and development, and I had the privilege of placing 2nd at the Work and Life AI Hackathon in NYC. I am passionate about building practical AI solutions and exploring how technology shapes our daily lives.
