# Edd  Joseph Jr.

I am an AI Engineer Intern at [UChicago Medicine/AdventHealth](https://www.uchicagomedicineadventhealth.org/) and the CTO of [Genba](https://www.trygenba.com/). My interests span across a spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development, artificial intelligence, creative coding, design, history, business, and human-technology interaction.

I am a CS student at Andrews University (graduating 2026 with BSc) and since starting college, I've spent years on software engineering and product development. I have also had the privilege of placing 2nd at the Work and Life AI Hackathon in NYC, with a medical AI solution that my team and I built. I am passionate about building practical AI solutions and exploring how technology shapes our daily lives.
